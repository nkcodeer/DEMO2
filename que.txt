A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. It is defined using {} and allows efficient data retrieval. Here's an example:

python
# Creating a dictionary
student = {
    "name": "Rahul",
    "age": 22,
    "course": "Computer Science",
    "grade": "A"
}

# Accessing values
print(student["name"])  # Output: Rahul
